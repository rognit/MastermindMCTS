    "J'ai choisi de ne pas utiliser de jeu de données externe mais de générer moi-même mes données d'entrainement grâce à des simulations encadrées par des règles.\n",
    "\n",
    "J'ai toujours été fasciné par les IA qui apprennent à jouer à des jeux en s'entrainant contre elles-mêmes et j'ai voulu faire ça moi aussi.\n",
    "Le jeu que j'ai choisi est le mastermind.\n",

    "## Règle du jeu\n",
    "\n",
    "Le jeu se joue à deux : un codificateur et un décodeur.\n",
    "Le but est de deviner, par déductions successives, la couleur de chacun des 4 pions cachés derrière un écran.\n",
    "Les couleurs possibles sont au nombre de 6 (rouge, vert, bleu, jaune, orange, violet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Déroulement du jeu : le codificateur pose à l'endroit prévu à cet effet, les 4 pions de son choix. Il doit prendre soin de ne pas révéler la couleur et la répartition dans les trous des pions. Rien ne l'empêche d'en choisir plusieurs d'une même couleur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Son adversaire, le décodeur, est chargé de déchiffrer ce code secret. Il doit le faire en 10 coups maximum. Il place 4 ou 5 pions dans les trous de la première rangée immédiatement près de lui. Si l'un des pions correspond par sa position et sa couleur à un pion caché derrière l'écran, le codificateur l'indique en plaçant une fiche noire dans l'un des trous de marque, sur le côté droit correspondant du plateau. Si l'un des pions correspond uniquement par sa couleur, le Codificateur l'indique par une fiche blanche dans l'un des trous de marque. S'il n'y a aucune correspondance, il ne marque rien.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le décodeur continue de poser des pions par rangées successives. La tactique consiste à sélectionner en fonction des coups précédents, couleurs et positions, de manière à obtenir le maximum d'informations de la réponse du partenaire puisque le nombre de propositions est limité par le nombre de rangées de trous du jeu. Dans la plupart des cas, il s'efforce de se rapprocher le plus possible de la solution, compte tenu des réponses précédentes, mais il peut aussi former une combinaison dans le seul but de vérifier une partie des conclusions des coups précédents et de faire en conséquence la proposition la plus propice à la déduction d'une nouvelle information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quand il est arrivé, au bout d'un certain nombre de coups, à placer les 4 pions qui correspondent exactement par la couleur et la position à ceux du code, la manche est terminée.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approche choisie\n",
    "\n",
    "Pour des raisons de curiosité, de performances, de temps et de complexité, j’ai choisi de ne pas m’orienter vers le Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "L’approche choisie est le **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "En informatique, et plus précisément en intelligence artificielle, la recherche arborescente Monte Carlo ou Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) est un algorithme de recherche heuristique utilisé dans le cadre de la prise de décision. Il est notamment employé dans les jeux. On peut citer son implémentation dans le jeu vidéo Total War: Rome II avec son mode campagne IA haut-niveau1 et les récents programmes informatiques de Go2, suivis par les échecs et shogi3, ainsi que les jeux vidéo en temps réel et les jeux à information incomplète tels que le poker4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image_jeu_Mastermind](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/MCTS.svg/1212px-MCTS.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "L'algorithme MCTS est un algorithme qui explore l'arbre des possibles. La racine est la configuration initiale du jeu. Chaque nœud est une configuration et ses enfants sont les configurations suivantes. MCTS conserve en mémoire un arbre qui correspond aux nœuds déjà explorés de l'arbre des possibles. Une feuille de cet arbre (un nœud n'ayant pas d'enfants) est soit une configuration finale (i.e. on sait si un des joueurs a gagné, ou s'il y a match nul), soit un nœud dont aucun enfant n'a encore été exploré. Dans chaque nœud, on stocke deux nombres : le nombre de simulations gagnantes, et le nombre total de simulations. Chaque étape est composée de quatre phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Sélection*: Depuis la racine, on sélectionne successivement des enfants jusqu'à atteindre une feuille. Dans cette phase, le choix des enfants est guidé par un compromis entre exploitation (aller vers un enfant qui a été prouvé comme prometteur) et exploration (aller visiter un autre enfant, qui a l'air moins prometteur mais qui pourrait l'être davantage). Dans l'exemple donné dans la figure, on choisit la feuille de gauche (de profondeur 3).\n",
    "2. *Expansion*: si cette feuille n'est pas finale, créer un enfant (ou plusieurs) en utilisant les règles du jeu et choisir l'un des enfants. Sur l'exemple, on ajoute cet enfant, marqué 0/0.\n",
    "3. *Simulation*: simuler une exécution d'une partie au hasard depuis cet enfant, jusqu'à atteindre une configuration finale.\n",
    "4. *Rétropropagation* (Backpropagation): utiliser le résultat de la partie au hasard et mettre à jour les informations sur la branche en partant du nœud enfant vers la racine. Sur l'exemple, la partie était perdante pour blanc. On incrémente donc uniquement le nombre de simulations totales sur la branche pour les nœuds blancs et on incrémente le nombre de simulations gagnées et le nombre de simulations totales pour les noirs sur la branche : 0/0 devient 0/1, 3/3 devient 3/4, 5/6 devient 5/7, 7/10 devient 7/11, et 12/21 devient 12/22. Si la partie avait été gagnante :0/0 serait devenu 1/1, 3/3 serait devenu 4/4, 5/6 serait devenu 6/7, 7/10 serait devenu 8/11, et 12/21 serait devenu 13/22.\n"
