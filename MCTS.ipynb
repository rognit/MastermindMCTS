    "# Règle du jeu\n",
    "\n",
    "Le jeu se joue à deux : un codificateur et un décodeur.\n",
    "Le but est de deviner, par déductions successives, la couleur de chacun des 4 pions cachés derrière un écran.\n",
    "Les couleurs possibles sont au nombre de 6 (rouge, vert, bleu, jaune, orange, violet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Déroulement du jeu : le codificateur pose à l'endroit prévu à cet effet, les 4 pions de son choix. Il doit prendre soin de ne pas révéler la couleur et la répartition dans les trous des pions. Rien ne l'empêche d'en choisir plusieurs d'une même couleur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Son adversaire, le décodeur, est chargé de déchiffrer ce code secret. Il doit le faire en 10 coups maximum. Il place 4 ou 5 pions dans les trous de la première rangée immédiatement près de lui. Si l'un des pions correspond par sa position et sa couleur à un pion caché derrière l'écran, le codificateur l'indique en plaçant une fiche noire dans l'un des trous de marque, sur le côté droit correspondant du plateau. Si l'un des pions correspond uniquement par sa couleur, le Codificateur l'indique par une fiche blanche dans l'un des trous de marque. S'il n'y a aucune correspondance, il ne marque rien.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le décodeur continue de poser des pions par rangées successives. La tactique consiste à sélectionner en fonction des coups précédents, couleurs et positions, de manière à obtenir le maximum d'informations de la réponse du partenaire puisque le nombre de propositions est limité par le nombre de rangées de trous du jeu. Dans la plupart des cas, il s'efforce de se rapprocher le plus possible de la solution, compte tenu des réponses précédentes, mais il peut aussi former une combinaison dans le seul but de vérifier une partie des conclusions des coups précédents et de faire en conséquence la proposition la plus propice à la déduction d'une nouvelle information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quand il est arrivé, au bout d'un certain nombre de coups, à placer les 4 pions qui correspondent exactement par la couleur et la position à ceux du code, la manche est terminée."
